# Code for general graph management and for finding CVCs in graph

Here I summed up the most relevant pieces of code that I created for this project, all written from scratch. In [code_final.py](code_final.py) you will find the class Graph: this class contains all methods that may be needed for general graph management in Python, and of course the DFS-CVC and GRASP-CVC algorithms. If you want to test the algorithms yourself you can download online the .stb or .mtx files of the DIMACS dataset (as an example here the download link to the [brock200-2.mtx] (https://networkrepository.com/brock200_2.php)).
