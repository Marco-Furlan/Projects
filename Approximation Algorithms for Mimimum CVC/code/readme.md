# Code for general graph management and for finding CVCs in graph

In "code_final.py" you will find the class Graph. This class contains all function that may be needed for general graph management in Python, and of course the algorithms to find CVCs. If you want to test the code yourself you can download online the .stb or .mtx files of the DIMACS dataset (as an example here the download link to the [brock200-2.mtx] (https://networkrepository.com/brock200_2.php)).
