In graph theory, a Vertex Cover 

### Definition: Euclidean Distance

The Euclidean distance between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) in a two-dimensional Cartesian plane is defined as:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

where:
- \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are the coordinates of the two points.
- \( d \) represents the Euclidean distance between the points.
