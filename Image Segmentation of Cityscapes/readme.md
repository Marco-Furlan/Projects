# Image Segmentation of Cityscapes

Video: [...]

In this project we trained and tested three Deep Learning algorithms, Deeplabv3, UNet and DenseASPP, for [image segmentation](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/image-segmentation.html) on the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/). The first two were trained from scratch, the third one was taken from [here](https://github.com/DeepMotionAIResearch/DenseASPP) and updated to work on the last Python and PyTorch versions. For more details refer to the video [...] or the [report](<https://github.com/Marco-Furlan/Projects/blob/main/Image Segmentation of Cityscapes/report.pdf>)

An example of their use is shown below:
