# Image Segmentation of Cityscapes

In this project we implemented three Deep Learning algorithms, Deeplabv3, UNet and DenseASPP, for image segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset. The first two were trained from scratch, the third one was taken from [here](https://github.com/DeepMotionAIResearch/DenseASPP) and updated to work on the last Python and PyTorch versions.

An example of their use can be seen here:
