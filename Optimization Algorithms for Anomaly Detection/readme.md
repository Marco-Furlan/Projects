# Optimization Algorithms for Anomaly Detection

One of the most challenging projects I had to face this far. Me and three dear friends from my Data Science course joined our forces to unlock the mathematics behind four algorithms:

- The Away-Step Frank-Wolfe algorithm,

- The Pairwise Frank-Wolfe algorithm,

- A first $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to MEB algorithm (Minimum Enclosing Ball),

- A second $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to MEB algorithm.

The original group code is uploaded [here](https://github.com/Optimization-project-exam/Optimization-for-Data-Science-project), my role code-wise was implementing from scratch the two Frank-Wolfe variations and testing them; furthermore I will add here a couple more details about this project.
