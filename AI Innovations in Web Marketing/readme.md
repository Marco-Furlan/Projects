From May to October 2024, I was awarded a scholarship from the **University of Padua**, during which I worked as a researcher for **[SiteBySite](https://www.sitebysite.it/)**, a leading **web marketing company** with offices in Padua and Milan. My primary focus was contributing to a region-funded project aimed at integrating **advanced AI innovations** across various aspects of the company's operations. The scholarship was funded by the **Human Inspired Technologies Research Centre (HIT)**, under the guidance of professors [Alessandro Sperduti](https://www.math.unipd.it/~sperduti/) and [Marco Zorzi](https://www.dpg.unipd.it/en/marco-zorzi/).

## The 3 applications of AI in Web Marketing

With [Alberto Narenti](https://www.sitebysite.it/noi/adv-team/alberto-narenti/) and [Riccardo Coni](https://www.sitebysite.it/noi/pm-team/riccardo-coni/), respectively ADV Manager and Project Manager at SiteBySite, we settled on three case studies to test the effectiveness of AI in different work areas of the company:

1. **Creation of Buyer Personas**

  <br>
</p>

Developing buyer personas is a critical step for a company to understand its target audience. These semi-fictional representations, based on market research and real customer data, help marketers identify the preferences, behaviors, and challenges of their ideal customers. Buyer personas serve as a foundation for creating personalized and effective marketing campaigns.

2. **Generation of web blogs and Instagram posts**

  <br>
</p>

Creating web blogs and Instagram posts is essential for building a strong online presence and engaging target audiences. By consistently generating high-quality, audience-focused content for both platforms, businesses can boost brand awareness, establish credibility, and encourage meaningful engagement, turning followers into loyal customers.

3. **Generation of infographics**

  <br>
</p>

Infographics combine concise text, striking visuals, and data-driven insights to capture attention and enhance understanding. For a company, they serve as an effective tool to engage audiences by simplifying concepts and telling compelling stories through design.

### GPT: A quick introduction

In the past few years, GPT and other large language models based on the **transformer architecture** have become fundamental tools in many applications, revolutionizing natural language processing with unparalleled performance in tasks like **text generation, translation, and coding**. In fact, both the text you're reading and the images you're seeing were generated by GPT. Fascinating, isnâ€™t it?


GPT, or **Generative Pre-trained Transformer**, uses massive training data to predict and generate human-like text, building on the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms from the influential "Attention Is All You Need" paper. Each GPT iteration has shown significant improvements, enabling nuanced prompt understanding and **few-shot learning**. Despite its strengths, GPT outputs may need fine-tuning or validation for accuracy. Success stories highlight combining **prompt engineering** with collaborative expertise for optimal results.
